/**
 * Implementation of this interface take an event, open it to extracts its data.
 * Then calls a specific pluggable task using this data as parameters
 * Usually, there is a one-to-one relationship between:
 *          event - processor - pluggable task
 * Yet, a processor can take care of many events, and deal with one pluggable task.
 * It can also deal with more than one pluggable task, but I don't see a reason 
 * for this.
